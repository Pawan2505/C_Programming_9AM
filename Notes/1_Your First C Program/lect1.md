### **C Program Basics**

**Program Skeleton:**

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

### **Line-by-Line (Easy Words):**

1. **`#include<stdio.h>`**

   * Brings in tools for input/output (like `printf`).
   * Without this, `printf` won’t work.

2. **`int main() { }`**

   * The **starting point** of every C program.
   * All your code goes inside `{ }`.

3. **`printf("Hello");`**

   * Shows text on the screen.
   * Always end with `;` (like ending a sentence).

4. **`return 0;`**

   * Tells the computer: program ran fine.
   * Like saying “All good, bye!”.

### **Key Words:**

* **`//`** → Single-line comment (for humans, computer ignores).
* **`/* ... */`** → Multi-line comment.
* **Function** → A small program inside your program that does one job.
* **Calling a function** → Using it by writing its name + `()` (e.g., `printf()`).
